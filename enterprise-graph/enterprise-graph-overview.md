# What is the Enterprise Graph?

Enterprise Graph by Microsoft enables you to build knowledge graphs that provide deeper insight into your business data. Bring many sources of data together to create one aggregate picture of your business knowledge, organised in entities and an ontology that you can customize for your business needs. Then query the graph through natural language or SPARQL.

## Availability

Enterprise Graph is currently available on a whitelist basis. If you think it's a good fit for your business and use cases, please <a href="mailto:eg-suport@microsoft.com?Subject=EG%20interest">contact us</a> and we'd love to talk.

## Key capabilities

* Create a graph with custom entities for your specific business, compiled from multiple data sources as required
* Resolve conflicts between different information sources to create one consistent graph of information and relationships
* Answer complex queries through the combination of data that would otherwise be in separate silos
* Bring powerful answers to all users through natural language, not just data scientists and analysts
* Discover new insights through the relationships between the entities in your graph

## Getting started

Check out the <a href="building-your-first-graph">ten-minute tutorial </a> for creating your first graph, and then dive into creating your own production system.
