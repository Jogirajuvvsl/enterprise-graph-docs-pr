# Enterprise Graph use cases

**One view of your data across silos**
Enterprise Graph enables you to bring all of your data together in one place, based on one central set of entities. For example the graph entry for a single person may combine data from HR, project management, sales, support, CRM or any other silo you want to connect. With the powerful ingestion and conflation tools of Enterprise Graph, all of your data can finally be unified in an understandable way.

**Find the conncetions in your data**
Enterprise Graph is build on entities and relationships from the ground up. Discover connections between your entities and data silos that you may otherwise never have found.

**Customizable for the real-world complexities of your business**
With Enterprise Graph you can extend the ontologies of entities that we provide, or you can create your own ontology from scratch. The powerful tools we provide mean that no matter how specific the entities you need - from chemical process compounds to product listings to customer records - you can define exactly what is required.

**API platform to create once, use anywhere**
The Enterprise Graph platform provides a comprehensive set of APIs to enable graph creation and updating, and a query API to return answers wherever you need them. You can run free-text search across the content of your entities, or run specific graph queries based on entity relationships using the SPARQL graph language.

**Create more powerful search and data experiences**
It has been a long time since search was just about links. Surface entity data and relationships in your search solutions, bringing the power of your graph directly to your users where they need it the most.

**Built Microsoft strong**
Enterprise Graph is built using the same technologies that power the knowledge and question-answering capabilities of the Bing search engine.
