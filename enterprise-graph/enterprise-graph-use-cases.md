# Applying a knowledge graph in your business

A knowledge graph composed of enterprise information lets you answer questions about your business. For example, let’s say that your company sells furniture, and your graph is aimed at external users. You may have entities in your graph for tables, chairs, couches, lamps and so on. For each entity, there may be attributes like price, description, collection name, model number, supplier, related products and so on. That would allow a customer to run a query like ‘Show me all kitchens’, and then refine it with, ‘Show me kitchen tables for less than $350’, and then to ask, ‘What chairs are sold with these tables?’ You can show the answers to these questions on a web page or through a digital assistant, or anywhere else your customers are asking questions about your business.

Alternatively, you might want a graph that is internally-focused to your business, and contains information like customer name, contact details, sales history, outstanding invoices, assigned account manager, and so on. That would enable queries like ‘Who is the account manager for Contoso?’ or ‘Show me customers that bought Product X’, where ‘Product X’ is one the products or services that your company sells.
