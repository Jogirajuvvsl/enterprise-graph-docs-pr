# Enterprise graph use-cases

The Enterprise Graph contains entities, their properties, and the links between them, all customizable for your business. Once this is in place, you can access that 'knowledge' through APIs, and incorporate it as needed.

## Powering AI assistance
A chat-based assistant combined with natural language understanding (for which there is a solution as part of the Enterprise Graph platform) can bring the power of the graph to every user in the business, not just the data or engineering teams. For example, if you included HR and organizational data in your graph, you could enable users to ask questions like 'Who is John Murphy's manager', and the Enterprise Graph platform can understand the user's query, turn it into a technical graph query, and return the answer. 

## Enriching search
The Enterprise Graph platform has built-in capabilities for graph search (i.e when you want to know a specific property or relationship of a given entity) as well as free-text search (i.e. when you are not quite sure which entity or property you need, but you want to see what the graph contains on a given topic). The graph can be a powerful augmentation to existing search solutions. For example, if your graph contains knowledge on documents that are linked to a specific project, it may more effective to ask a question like 'Show me all the documents related to the Alpha project' versus just searching for the term 'Alpha project'.

## Combining many sources of data into one source of truth

The advanced conflation tools included with the Enterprise Graph enable you take many individual sources of information and combine them into one graph based on one ontology. You can handle errors and inconsistencies between the data sources, and define the rules you want to use to combine them at scale. For example, the entity type for a person may be made up of data sources from HR, your customer relationship management system, your project management system, external social feeds, and any other source of data that is relevant to your end goals.


## Reflecting the nuances of your specific business

Every business has detailed, deep knowledge that is specific to that business and its context within the industry. No standard-issue ontology can hope to reflect the exact information and knowledge that you need, and so the Enterprise Graph platform offers a completely customizable ontology. That means that no matter how specific the needs of your business, the Enterprise Graph platform can meet them. An entity can be defined to represent any concept you need, from a custom machine part to the individual chemicals in a manufacturing process to the dig sites for oil exploration. Whatever you need, you can build.
