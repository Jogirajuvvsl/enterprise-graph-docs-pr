# Schema maps

THIS IS A NEW EDIT

Once your source schema is in place, you can complete the mapping step by creating a source schema. In the interface it looks like this:

![Schema mapping](./media/schema_mapping/schema_mapping_ux.png)

On the left side is the ontology that you defined in step one, representing the concepts that you need for the use cases you want to enable. On the right is the schema map we defined previously, which describe how your data is structured.

To to create the links between the source schema and the ontology, use the checkbox on the right and then click on the object name in the left column.

## Using a mapping file

To understand the formatting of the mapping file you can use, please see the schema mapping conceptual overview. That allows you to access the same functionality as the interface, defined in an XML file.
