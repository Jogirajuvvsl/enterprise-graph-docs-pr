# Building your first graph

To get started with the Enterprise graph, we've provided everything you need to complete the graph-build process end to end.

## (1) Creating an ontology

Your ontology is the like the 'dictionary' of your graph, containing the definitions of the entities you want to use and what properties they have. The ontology defines the entity types, and then later we'll import data to create actual entities. So for example, in this step we'll define a 'City' entity that has a 'CityName' property, and later on we'll create actual city entites, e.g. Kniman, Cubero and so on.

To get started...

# Key capabilities

* Create a graph with custom entities for your specific business, compiled from multiple data sources as required
* Resolve conflicts between different information sources to create one consistent graph of information and relationships
* Answer complex queries through the combination of data that would otherwise be in separate silos
* Bring powerful answers to all users through natural language, not just data scientists and analysts
* Discover new insights through the relationships between the entities in your graph
