# SPARQL queries

Enterprise Graph enables you to bring many sources of data about your business together in one place. The graph is composed of entities and the relationships between them, based on a custom ontology for your business. Once you have created it you can run natural language queries on it, or use the SPARQL query language.

## Availability

Enterprise Graph is currently available on a whitelist basis. If you think it's a good fit for your business and use cases, please contact us and we'd love to talk. Stephen: Contact process to follow.

## Key capabilities

* Create a graph with custom entities for your specific business, compiled from multiple data sources as required
* Resolve conflicts between different information sources to create one consistent graph of information and relationships
* Answer complex queries through the combination of data that would otherwise be in separate silos
* Bring powerful answers to all users through natural language, not just data scientists and analysts
* Discover new insights through the relationships between the entities in your graph
