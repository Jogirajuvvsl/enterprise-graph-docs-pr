# SPARQL

To run queries on the Enterprise Graph you can either ask natural language questions, or you can write queries in SPARQL. You can submit queries either in the Enterprise Graph interface or using the API.

A full discussion of SPARQL is outside the scope of this documentation, but check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">Wikipedia entry</a> for an overview guide.
